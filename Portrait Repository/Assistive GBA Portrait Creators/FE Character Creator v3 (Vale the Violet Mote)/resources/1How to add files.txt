Any file of the proper format can be added to this folder to be used in the Character Creator.

Token files must be 64x64 and end in "_Token.png"

All others must be 96x96 and end in one of the following:
"_Face.png", "_Hair.png", _"Hairb.png", "_Armor.png", "_Acc.png"*

*Acc stands for accessories. It is implemented, but I only included two for test purposes.

All files must conform to a certain color scheme in order to work properly.
Each color has a red, green, and blue value. This program only looks at the RED values.
Every red units correspond to a different body part/armor section.

Divide the red value by 10, then use the following scales:

For _Face and _Acc files:
0 - outline color
1 - eye and beard color (light) (Sorry, they're linked for now)
2 - eye and beard color (base)
3 - eye and beard color (dark)
4 - skin color (light)
5 - skin color (base)
6 - skin color (dark)
7 - skin color (darker)
8 - skin color (darkest)
9 - accessory color (light)
10 - accessory color (base)
11 - accessory color (dark)

For _Armor and _Hair(b) files:
0 - outline color
1 - hair color (light)
2 - hair color (base)
3 - hair color (dark)
4 - skin color (light)
5 - skin color (base)
6 - skin color (dark)
7 - skin color (darker)
8 - skin color (darkest)
9 - metal color (light)
10 - metal color (base)
11 - metal color (dark)
12 - trim color (light)
13 - trim color (base)
14 - trim color (dark)
15 - cloth color (light)
16 - cloth color (base)
17 - cloth color (dark)
18 - leather color (light)
19 - leather color (base)
20 - leather color (dark)

In this newest version of the Character Creator, eye color has been separated from hair color.
However, they share a red value with facial hair, and therefore can't be separated unless
EVERY image is changed so that the eyes and facial hair have different red values.
